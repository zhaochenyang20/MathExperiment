<span id="coc-reporting-manual"></span><h1>SciPy Code of Conduct - How to follow up on a report<a class="headerlink" href="#scipy-code-of-conduct-how-to-follow-up-on-a-report" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>This is the manual followed by SciPy’s Code of Conduct Committee. It’s used
when we respond to an issue to make sure we’re consistent and fair.</p>
<p>Enforcing the Code of Conduct impacts our community today and for the future.
It’s an action that we do not take lightly. When reviewing enforcement
measures, the Code of Conduct Committee will keep the following values and
guidelines in mind:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Act in a personal manner rather than impersonal. The Committee can engage
the parties to understand the situation, while respecting the privacy and any
necessary confidentiality of reporters. However, sometimes, it is necessary
to communicate with one or more individuals directly: the Committee’s goal is
to improve the health of our community rather than only produce a formal
decision.</p></li>
<li><p>Emphasize empathy for individuals rather than judging behavior, avoiding
binary labels of “good” and “bad/evil”. Overt, clear-cut aggression and
harassment exists and we will be address that firmly. But many scenarios
that can prove challenging to resolve are those where normal disagreements
devolve into unhelpful or harmful behavior from multiple parties.
Understanding the full context and finding a path that re-engages all is
hard, but ultimately the most productive for our community.</p></li>
<li><p>We understand that email is a difficult medium and can be isolating.
Receiving criticism over email, without personal contact, can be
particularly painful. This makes it especially important to keep an
atmosphere of open-minded respect of the views of others. It also means
that we must be transparent in our actions, and that we will do everything
in our power to make sure that all our members are treated fairly and with
sympathy.</p></li>
<li><p>Discrimination can be subtle and it can be unconscious. It can show itself
as unfairness and hostility in otherwise ordinary interactions. We know
that this does occur, and we will take care to look out for it. We would
very much like to hear from you if you feel you have been treated unfairly,
and we will use these procedures to make sure that your complaint is heard
and addressed.</p></li>
<li><p>Help increase engagement in good discussion practice: try to identify where
discussion may have broken down and provide actionable information, pointers
and resources that can lead to positive change on these points.</p></li>
<li><p>Be mindful of the needs of new members: provide them with explicit support
and consideration, with the aim of increasing participation from
underrepresented groups in particular.</p></li>
<li><p>Individuals come from different cultural backgrounds and native languages.
Try to identify any honest misunderstandings caused by a non-native speaker
and help them understand the issue and what they can change to avoid causing
offense. Complex discussion in a foreign language can be very intimidating,
and we want to grow our diversity also across nationalities and cultures.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Mediation</em>: voluntary, informal mediation is a tool at our disposal. In
contexts, such as when two or more parties have all escalated to the point of
inappropriate behavior (something sadly common in human conflict), it may be
useful to facilitate a mediation process. This is only an example: the
Committee can consider mediation in any case, mindful that the process is meant
to be strictly voluntary and no party can be pressured to participate. If the
Committee suggests mediation, it should:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Find a candidate who can serve as a mediator.</p></li>
<li><p>Obtain the agreement of the reporter(s). The reporter(s) have complete
freedom to decline the mediation idea, or to propose an alternate mediator.</p></li>
<li><p>Obtain the agreement of the reported person(s).</p></li>
<li><p>Settle on the mediator: while parties can propose a different mediator than
the suggested candidate, only if common agreement is reached on all terms can
the process move forward.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish a timeline for mediation to complete, ideally within two weeks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The mediator will engage with all the parties and seek a resolution that is
satisfactory to all. Upon completion, the mediator will provide a report
(vetted by all parties to the process) to the Committee, with recommendations
on further steps. The Committee will then evaluate these results (whether
satisfactory resolution was achieved or not) and decide on any additional
action deemed necessary.</p>
<section id="how-the-committee-will-respond-to-reports">
<h2>How the committee will respond to reports<a class="headerlink" href="#how-the-committee-will-respond-to-reports" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>When the committee (or a committee member) receives a report, they will first
determine whether the report is about a clear and severe breach (as defined
below). If so, immediate action needs to be taken in addition to the regular
report-handling process.</p>
<section id="clear-and-severe-breach-actions">
<h3>Clear and severe breach actions<a class="headerlink" href="#clear-and-severe-breach-actions" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>We know that it is painfully common for internet communication to start at or
devolve into obvious and flagrant abuse. We will deal quickly with clear and
severe breaches like personal threats, violent, sexist, or racist language.</p>
<p>When a member of the Code of Conduct committee becomes aware of a clear and
severe breach, they will do the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Immediately disconnect the originator from all SciPy communication channels.</p></li>
<li><p>Reply to the reporter that their report has been received and that the
originator has been disconnected.</p></li>
<li><p>In every case, the moderator should make a reasonable effort to contact the
originator, and tell them specifically how their language or actions
qualify as a “clear and severe breach”. The moderator should also say
that, if the originator believes this is unfair or they want to be
reconnected to SciPy, they have the right to ask for a review, as below, by
the Code of Conduct Committee.
The moderator should copy this explanation to the Code of Conduct Committee.</p></li>
<li><p>The Code of Conduct Committee will formally review and sign off on all cases
where this mechanism has been applied to make sure it is not being used to
control ordinary heated disagreement.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="report-handling">
<h3>Report handling<a class="headerlink" href="#report-handling" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>When a report is sent to the committee, they will immediately reply to the
reporter to confirm receipt. This reply must be sent within 72 hours, and the
group should strive to respond much quicker than that.</p>
<p>If a report doesn’t contain enough information, the committee will obtain all
relevant data before acting. The committee is empowered to act on the Steering
Council’s behalf in contacting any individuals involved to get a more complete
account of events.</p>
<p>The committee will then review the incident and determine, to the best of their
ability:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What happened.</p></li>
<li><p>Whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation.</p></li>
<li><p>Who are the responsible party(ies).</p></li>
<li><p>Whether this is an ongoing situation, and there is a threat to anyone’s
physical safety.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This information will be collected in writing, and whenever possible the
group’s deliberations will be recorded and retained (i.e., chat transcripts,
email discussions, recorded conference calls, summaries of voice conversations,
etc.).</p>
<p>It is important to retain an archive of all activities of this committee to
ensure consistency in behavior and provide institutional memory for the
project. To assist in this, the default channel of discussion for this
committee will be a private mailing list accessible to current and future
members of the committee as well as members of the Steering Council upon
justified request. If the Committee finds the need to use off-list
communications (e.g., phone calls for early/rapid response), it should, in all
cases, summarize these back to the list so there’s a good record of the process.</p>
<p>The Code of Conduct Committee should aim to have a resolution agreed upon within
two weeks. In the event that a resolution can’t be determined in that time, the
committee will respond to the reporter(s) with an update and projected timeline
for the resolution.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="resolutions">
<span id="coc-resolutions"></span><h2>Resolutions<a class="headerlink" href="#resolutions" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The committee must agree on a resolution by consensus. If the group cannot reach
consensus and deadlocks for over a week, the group will turn the matter over to
the Steering Council for resolution.</p>
<p>Possible responses may include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Taking no further action:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>if we determine no violations have occurred.</p></li>
<li><p>if the matter has been resolved publicly while the committee was considering responses.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Coordinating voluntary mediation: if all involved parties agree, the
Committee may facilitate a mediation process as detailed above.</p></li>
<li><p>Remind publicly, and point out that some behavior/actions/language have been
judged inappropriate and why in the current context, or can but hurtful to
some people, requesting the community to self-adjust.</p></li>
<li><p>A private reprimand from the committee to the individual(s) involved. In this
case, the group chair will deliver that reprimand to the individual(s) over
email, cc’ing the group.</p></li>
<li><p>A public reprimand. In this case, the committee chair will deliver that
reprimand in the same venue that the violation occurred, within the limits of
practicality. E.g., the original mailing list for an email violation, but
for a chat room discussion where the person/context may be gone, they can be
reached by other means. The group may choose to publish this message
elsewhere for documentation purposes.</p></li>
<li><p>A request for a public or private apology, assuming the reporter agrees to
this idea: they may, at their discretion, refuse further contact with the
violator. The chair will deliver this request. The committee may, if it
chooses, attach “strings” to this request: for example, the group may ask a
violator to apologize, in order to retain one’s membership on a mailing list.</p></li>
<li><p>A “mutually agreed upon hiatus” where the committee asks the individual to
temporarily refrain from community participation. If the individual chooses
not to take a temporary break voluntarily, the committee may issue a
“mandatory cooling off period”.</p></li>
<li><p>A permanent or temporary ban from some or all SciPy spaces (mailing lists,
gitter.im, etc.). The group will maintain records of all such bans so that
they may be reviewed in the future or otherwise maintained.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, the committee will
contact the original reporter and any other affected parties and explain the
proposed resolution. The committee will ask if this resolution is acceptable,
and must note feedback for the record.</p>
<p>Finally, the committee will make a report to the SciPy Steering Council (as
well as the SciPy core team in the event of an ongoing resolution, such as a
ban).</p>
<p>The committee will never publicly discuss the issue; all public statements will
be made by the chair of the Code of Conduct Committee or the SciPy Steering
Council.</p>
</section>
<section id="conflicts-of-interest">
<h2>Conflicts of interest<a class="headerlink" href="#conflicts-of-interest" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>In the event of any conflict of interest, a committee member must immediately
notify the other members, and recuse themselves if necessary.</p>
